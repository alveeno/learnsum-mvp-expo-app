# LearnSum (Expo frontend)

> **Expo SDK 56 has breaking changes from earlier versions.** Read the exact versioned
> docs at https://docs.expo.dev/versions/v56.0.0/ before writing any code. Do not rely on
> patterns from older SDKs.

## Project

LearnSum is a Hong Kong–based, two-sided tutoring marketplace **frontend**, built in
React Native and Expo. It connects to a separate Next.js backend API that lives in a
different repository, **`learnsum-mvp-back`**.

Tutors build Instagram-style profiles with a bio block and a scrollable post feed. The
primary tutor target is university students looking for side income.

There are three user types:

- **parent**
- **student**
- **tutor**

## Stack

- **Expo SDK 56** (`expo ~56.0.8`)
- **Expo Router** (`~56.2.8`) — file-based routing; entry is `expo-router/entry`
- **NativeWind v4** (`4.2.1`) with **Tailwind CSS v3** (`tailwindcss 3.4.17`)
- **React Native 0.85** (`0.85.3`)
- **React 19.2** (`19.2.3`)
- **TypeScript** throughout (`~6.0.3`)
- Supporting native modules: `expo-linking`, `expo-status-bar`, `expo-dev-client`,
  `@expo/metro-runtime`, `react-native-reanimated@4.3.1`, `react-native-worklets`,
  `react-native-safe-area-context`

## Backend connection

- **All API calls go through the Next.js backend** at `EXPO_PUBLIC_API_URL`.
  Never call Supabase directly from this app.
- The backend is **currently at `http://localhost:3000`** — **update this to the Vercel
  URL after deployment.**
- For the full database schema and API endpoint reference, see **`PLAN.md` in the backend
  repo (`learnsum-mvp-back`)**.

## Design system

| Token            | Value     |
| ---------------- | --------- |
| Primary          | Forest Green `#2D6A4F` |
| Accent           | Gold `#F4A923` |
| Background        | White `#FFFFFF` |
| Surface          | Off-white `#F9F9F7` |
| Muted text        | `#6B7280` |
| Destructive       | `#E63946` |

UI conventions:

- **Circular avatars** everywhere.
- **16pt rounded corners** on cards.
- **Pill-shaped buttons.**
- Icons via **`@expo/vector-icons`**.

## Navigation structure

File-based routes (Expo Router). v1 route map:

| Route                 | Purpose |
| --------------------- | ------- |
| `/`                   | Welcome screen with user-type selection |
| `/onboarding/student` | Student onboarding |
| `/onboarding/parent`  | Parent onboarding |
| `/onboarding/tutor`   | Tutor onboarding |
| `/feed`               | Home feed |
| `/tutors/[slug]`      | Tutor profile page |
| `/search`             | Browse and filter |
| `/notifications`      | Notification centre |
| `/profile`            | Own profile and settings |

**No messaging screen in v1.** Contact happens via WhatsApp redirect and inquiry form
only — there is no `/messages` route.

> Current implementation status: only `app/_layout.tsx` and `app/index.tsx` exist so far.
> The rest of the routes above are the v1 target and are not yet built.

## Architecture decisions

- **Contact flow:** WhatsApp redirect is the primary path; the inquiry form is the
  fallback. **No in-app messaging in v1.**
- **Guest home feed** shows the latest published tutors with **no personalisation**.
- **Tutor profile pages are public** and viewable **without auth**.
- **Auth is required only for:** posting content, sending inquiries, and accessing
  notifications and profile.

## Development workflow

This project uses **EAS Build for iOS development builds** because local builds overheat
the MacBook Air M2.

- **Run the dev server:**
  ```
  npx expo start --clear
  ```
- **Install the latest development build on the simulator:**
  ```
  /Users/alveeno/.npm-global/bin/eas build:run --platform ios --latest
  ```
- **When native dependencies change**, a new EAS cloud build is required before the
  simulator will pick up the changes:
  ```
  /Users/alveeno/.npm-global/bin/eas build --platform ios --profile development
  ```

Environment: **macOS**, **Terminal**, **single-line commands only**.

## Environment variables

Stored in **`.env.local`** — **never committed**.

| Variable                       | Description |
| ------------------------------ | ----------- |
| `EXPO_PUBLIC_API_URL`          | Base URL of the Next.js backend |
| `EXPO_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_URL`     | Supabase project URL |
| `EXPO_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY`| Supabase anon key |
